# Mechanics-js-simulation
Simulation of a mechanical sistem using javascript

## What is this ?
A Challenge, and an idea from one of my friends (DAROVA VADIM !!!!).

## What is the goal ?

* Simulate a [drive belt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_(mechanical)) mechanism

* Learn something new
    * documentation
    * JS canvas API
    * mechanics

## What I'm currently working on:

Learning the basics and stuff, by tring to make a [2d engine](https://github.com/hoxu-1/Mechanics-js-simulation/tree/main/2d_engine)
